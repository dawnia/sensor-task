"""
Once the params are selected on an initial screen and the "start" button is pressed, the COGame class (within main.py) is instantiated.

The COGame.init() function then runs, and every 1/60th of a second the COGame.update() function runs. 

From there, the game reads from different sensors (here, touches on the screen) and decides what "state" the task is in. 

It has a state transition dictionary (self.FSM) that it cycles through depending on whether the subject has finished a trial, is still doing a trial, etc.

Code needs to write a) time, b) sensor values, c) trial number, d) trial type, e) trial state at every task loop

sampling rate 50hz
Connect to sensor input (ie know when itâ€™s reset)
